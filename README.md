Generate insights through summary statistics and data profiling.
Data Visualization:

Create informative visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
Develop interactive dashboards to present findings in a user-friendly manner.
Predictive Modeling:

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict outcomes or classify data.
Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
Reporting and Documentation:

Document the analysis process, findings, and methodologies.
Prepare a comprehensive report or presentation to communicate results effectively.
Tools and Libraries:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
Outcome:

Demonstrate advanced data analysis skills and provide actionable insights.
